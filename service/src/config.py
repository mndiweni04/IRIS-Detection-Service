# Blink threshold: ESP32 sends IR in mV (0-3300 mV range)
# Normal eye open: ~300-500 mV
# Eye closed (blink): ~50-200 mV
# Using 250 mV as threshold to detect blinks (when IR drops below this)
BLINK_THRESHOLD = 250  # mV (was 1000, now corrected for your sensor range)

NOD_THRESHOLD = 0.5    # g, threshold to detect nodding frequency
